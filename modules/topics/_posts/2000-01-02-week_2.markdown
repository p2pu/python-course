#Dear Pythonian,

We now enter the second week of this course. If you’ve not completed the first week, __don’t panic!__ You’re probably not alone and no points are deducted for working at your own pace. Plus, now there are others working ahead of you that can help you out. Did you signed up for the [forum] (http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python) yet?

Ok, let's just dive right in. Here’s what’s up for this week:

##Reading
Get to know some "smooth" operators and other good stuff in sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4-4.7, 6.1 & 6.2 from [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html ) book.

##Doing
I like this Codecademy exercises very much. For this week I thought it woudld be great to get to know a bit more about [Conditionals and Control Flow]( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python) – (Unit 3) 


##Homework

* Complete sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.8 and 1.7 and optional exercises from Handout 1 of 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw1.pdf )
 
* Complete sections 1.13, 1.14, and 1.15 from Written Exercises 1 of 6.189 A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science ( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw1_written.pdf ) 


##Important!

Remember if you are having problem understanding a concept, don't fret. You can always ask fellow Pythonic learners at the [forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python). I am always there too.

MOOC on!
