#Dear MOOCie-ians,

The start of the *A Gentle Introduction to Python* is here! We begin our journey with a reading and some exercises from Codecademy before tackling the first homework assignment. You should try to finish this material in the first week.

##Materials:

* Chapters 1 and 2, section 4.12, from [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html ).
* [Python Units "Python Syntax" and "Strings and console input"]( http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python ) 
 Codecademy


Tasks:

* Complete sections 1.1 – 1.4 from Handout 1 of 6.189 [A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science]( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw1.pdf)
	> Please Note: The “homework 1.py” file referred to in the above handout is available on the assignments page of the 6.189 course materials, and is labled “Code template (PY)” on that page. you can also download it [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/hw1.py) 
* Complete section 1.9 from Written Exercises 1 of 6.189 [A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science]( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw1_written.pdf) 


Let your learning style be your guide with the materials. If you like to learn by doing, dive into the Codecademy exercises; if you are a reader, start with the text; or if you prefer a lecture-style introduction, begin with the videos. Once you are done with all three, move on to the homework.

Remember, if at any time you have questions, go over to [P2PU's forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python). The rest of the young Pythonistas are hanging there and are ready to 
discuss anything. 

MOOC-E leaves you with something of a chuckle….
