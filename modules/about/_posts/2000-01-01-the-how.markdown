#What is this course all about?

This course will provide a gentle introduction to programming. During this course, we will be using Python programming language. Yes, Python is a snake, I know, but this is a good kind of snake, promise! <3 

The course is suitable for __everyone__ who wants to learn about programming. If you have little or no prior experience with programming, but you are motivated to learn it, we will have lots of fun together.

## How it works?

{{ site.course_start }}, once a week, I will send an assignment message to your inbox. Each message will reveal great resources that exist on the open web. I combined open materials, to make relevant packages just for you... For us, to be able to learn together.

Sometimes the content from the different tools may not sync up exactly. So be patient. I also encourage to you explore the resources I give you, and the open web. It is a fun place!

In each message, I will signal your attention toward combination of:

* Selected readings from the [MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm){:target="_blank"}'s course [A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011){:target="_blank"}'s text, [__How to Think Like a Computer Scientist__]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/){:target="_blank"} 
	
* Exercises from [__Codecademy__](http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0){:target="_blank"} 

* Homework sets from [MIT OCW](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm){:target="_blank"}'s course [__A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python__]( http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/){:target="_blank"} 

And you always want to come to:
[__discussion forums__](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python){:target="_blank"} , where you can meet me and others and will be able to get all the help and support you need. I also encourage you to log in and check if there is anyone that would need your help. We all know that knowledge gained by explaining is much deeper, thus much more rewarding. 
So if you have questions, are struggling or just want to chat with other folks, [discussion forums space](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python){:target="_blank"}  is the right place for you to do so.

I will present the materials in a recommended order, but really you can attack them in whatever order you prefer–though it will almost always make sense to do the exercises last.

> Important: I will not grade homework (happy times). In most cases you can check your own work using the Python interpreter (If you don't know what that is, don't worry, when we start this is going to be something you will learn about). If you get stuck or can’t come up with a correct answer, ask for help at [discussion forums](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python){:target="_blank"} . Remember, the goal here is to become a great programmer, not to submit a bunch of correct answers.


#When Do We Start?

The course begins on {{ site.course_start }}, so MOOC-E asks you to kindly start your engines.


Soon, my young knowledge wells, this shall be you:

#History lesson first
This course already ran 5 times in the past 3 years and every time it was very successful. You can read all about it in the [report](http://reports.p2pu.org/mooc-maker/){:target="_blank"}. It was all possible because of one person. Ladies and gentlemen, meet the father of this course [Mr. Steve Carson](https://twitter.com/SteveECarson){:target="_blank"}. He was the one that had gathered the exercises together and bravely paved the way for me. The most amazing thing about him is that he wasn't a computer programmer at all. Just had a desire to learn and participate on an experiment called the Mechanical MOOC. 

__Thank you Steve! MOOC-E and the whole P2PU team is very proud that we are able to work with you.__

My robotic heart thanks you for your valor thus far,
