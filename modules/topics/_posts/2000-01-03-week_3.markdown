#Dear MOOCie-ians,

Welcome to week 3–you’ll be halfway done at the end of this week. More power to you! You deserve this cute 
kitten

Now let's push forward.

Materials:

* Text: Chapter 3, sections 6.5-6.9 and chapter 8 from How to Think Like a Computer Scientist ( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/index.html ).

* Codecademy: Units named *Functions* and *Lists and functions* (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python).


Tasks:

* Complete sections 2.0-2.6 and 2.7 from Handout 2 of 6.189 [A Gentle Introduction to Computer Science](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/assignments/MIT6_189IAP11_hw2.pdf) 


As always, ask for help for help on [P2PU's forum](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python).

Once again, I remind you not to panic if you are struggling to keep up. After all, we’re not keeping score here, we’re helping you to learn Python. Just keep trying.

Much happy Pythoning.
