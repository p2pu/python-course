title: What do I need to install?

#Installing...

We will be using Python programming language because it is quite simple to learn.  
 
In the exercises, we are using Codeacademy as a practical learning, but since we would like to make our own projects we need to install Python on the computers we will be working on.

The computers who's operating systems are Linux, already have Python installed by default. 

Everybody else need to install it before we begin.  

[Here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/lectures/MIT6_189IAP11_start.pdf){:target="_blank"} are some instructions on how to do that and how to try it out after installation has been successful.

If you are having problems with installation of Python to your computer, you can always ask other people, who are taking this course on the [community space](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python){:target="_blank"}. Chances are you are not the only one with the problems, and you can always find help there. 

> Important: The installation guide emphasizes to be careful when installing Python, and not to install any other version than Python 2.6. I think it is OK to install Python version 2.7, however __do not__ install Python version 3. All of our exercises are compatible with older versions of Python, so it is much better to choose that one.


###Other things you need to do, to get prepared:   
  
* As I already mentioned somewhere before, create an account at the [discussion forums](http://discourse.p2pu.org/c/gentle-introduction-to-python){:target="_blank"}. You will be able to get support there, meet me and a lot of other very interesting people. No person is an island, so I recommend you start meeting people as soon as possible. There are probably people who need your help there too. Don't be shy, pop over and say hi. 
 
* As one of the practical parts of the course we will be using amazing [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0){:target="_blank"}. For this, we need to create an account with them. This is so we will know how much did we already learn. The tool is very interesting, so I recommend you try it out.
 
 
 Thanks, and may the snake be with you.
